pTorrent File Sharing Network
(Programming Studio Final Project)

author: Paul Rachwalski

SUMMARY:
    The pTorrent project is a peer-to-peer file sharing network, based on a (very) simplified model of the BitTorrent
    network.
    The main aspect taken from the BitTorrent network is the concept of a tracker server, which is a server
    that peers can poll to get associated IP addresses for a file from, which allows the peer to download from as many
    active hosts as are available.
